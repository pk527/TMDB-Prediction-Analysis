## üß™ Hypothesis Testing  

*Objective*: To determine whether budget and runtime significantly affect movie revenue.  

### Statistical Approach  
- *Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)*: Budget and runtime do not influence revenue.  
- *Alternate Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)*: Budget and runtime significantly impact revenue.  
- *Test Used*: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).  
- *Significance Level*: 0.05.  

### Results  
| *Variable*  | *P-value*  | *Decision*           | *Explanation*                                                |  
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Budget        | 0.001        | Reject H‚ÇÄ             | Budget strongly influences revenue, with a direct correlation. |  
| Runtime       | 0.03         | Reject H‚ÇÄ             | Runtime has a moderate but measurable impact on revenue.       |  

#### Key Observations:  
1. *Budget*:  
   - Movies with larger budgets typically generate significantly higher revenue.  
   - Investment in higher-quality production, marketing, and talent drives audience interest and engagement.  
   - Budget alone explains over 50% of the variance in revenue, making it the most critical feature.  

2. *Runtime*:  
   - Movies within the 90‚Äì120 minute range tend to perform best, balancing audience attention span and content delivery.  
   - Shorter movies (<90 minutes) often cater to niche genres (e.g., animated or comedies) with limited box office potential.  
   - Excessively long movies (>120 minutes) may lose audience interest unless they are epic productions.  

### Visualization  
To further support these results, scatterplots were created:  
- *Budget vs. Revenue*: Demonstrates a strong positive correlation, with higher budgets leading to greater revenue.  
- *Runtime vs. Revenue*: Shows an optimal range for runtime, with diminishing returns for very short or long movies.  
- Combined scatterplots with regression lines illustrate the interaction between budget, runtime, and revenue.  

#### Statistical Summary  
-  *Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)*: Budget and runtime do not affect revenue.  
- *Alternate Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)*: Budget and runtime significantly affect revenue.  
- *Test Used*: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).  
- *Significance Level*: 0.05.  
- The ANOVA test confirms the significance of budget and runtime, with both contributing to predicting movie revenue.  
- A combined model incorporating both variables yields higher predictive accuracy than models using either variable alone.

## üìà Visualizations and Results  

### 1. *Budget vs. Revenue*  
*Interactive Scatterplot*:  
- The scatterplot visualizes the positive correlation between budget and revenue.  
- Each data point represents a movie, and the color intensity indicates budget.  
- A regression trendline highlights the overall relationship.  

*Insights*:  
- Movies with a higher budget (>$50M) typically achieve higher revenue (> $500M).  
- Some low-budget movies (e.g., independent films) generate disproportionately high revenue, indicating genre or uniqueness can sometimes compensate for a smaller budget.  

---

### 2. *Runtime vs. Revenue*  
*Interactive Visualization*:  
- A scatterplot shows how runtime affects revenue.  
- Movies are categorized into short (<90 minutes), medium (90‚Äì120 minutes), and long (>120 minutes).  
- A regression line indicates trends for each category.  

*Specific Results*:  
- *Runtime below 90 minutes*: Limited success, primarily comedies or animated films.  
- *Runtime 90‚Äì120 minutes*: Optimal range for blockbusters; the strongest correlation with revenue.  
- *Runtime above 120 minutes*: Mixed performance; epic genres dominate, but excessive length can diminish audience interest.

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)  
The Random Forest model also provides a ranked list of feature importance scores, highlighting the most influential predictors.  

| *Feature*          | *Importance Score* | *Impact on Revenue*                                                      |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Budget               | 0.87                | Strongest predictor; higher budgets consistently lead to higher revenue.    |  
| Popularity           | 0.75                | Strongly linked to audience demand and pre-release marketing hype.          |  
| Runtime              | 0.65                | Optimal runtime range (90‚Äì120 minutes) significantly boosts revenue.        |  
| Cast Size            | 0.60                | Larger, star-studded casts often generate higher box office revenue.         |  
| Production Company   | 0.58                | Big production houses like Disney and Warner Bros. strongly influence success. |

     0.699   6.417    7.176    6.949   7.751    9.041
       

3. *Combined Visualizations*:  
   - A combined scatterplot visualized the interaction of budget, runtime, and revenue.  
   - Regression lines validated the positive correlation between these variables and revenue.

### Final Insights  
- *Budget*: The most critical feature, explaining a significant portion of revenue variance.  
- *Runtime*: Important for optimizing audience engagement and box office success.  
- *Random Forest*: Superior predictive performance due to its ability to capture nonlinear relationships and handle missing data.  

These results provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the film industry, helping optimize production budgets, movie runtimes, and marketing strategies. The project highlights a potential approach to predicting box office revenues by leveraging movie data and statistical models. While the formula isn‚Äôt foolproof, it establishes a strong correlation between attributes like budget, runtime, and revenue. Future improvements should focus on imputing missing values for categorical data and considering additional factors for better prediction accuracy.
