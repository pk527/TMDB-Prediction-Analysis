- Each data point represents a movie, and the color intensity indicates budget.  
- A regression trendline highlights the overall relationship.  

*Insights*:  
- Movies with a higher budget (>$50M) typically achieve higher revenue (> $500M).  
- Some low-budget movies (e.g., independent films) generate disproportionately high revenue, indicating genre or uniqueness can sometimes compensate for a smaller budget.

*Interactive Visualization*:  
- A scatterplot shows how runtime affects revenue.  
- Movies are categorized into short (<90 minutes), medium (90‚Äì120 minutes), and long (>120 minutes).  
- A regression line indicates trends for each category.  

*Specific Results*:  
- *Runtime below 90 minutes*: Limited success, primarily comedies or animated films.  
- *Runtime 90‚Äì120 minutes*: Optimal range for blockbusters; the strongest correlation with revenue.  
- *Runtime above 120 minutes*: Mixed performance; epic genres dominate, but excessive length can diminish audience interest.  

---

### 3. *Hypothesis Testing*  
*Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)*: Runtime and budget do not affect revenue.  
*Alternate Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)*: Runtime and budget significantly affect revenue.  

*Statistical Approach*:  
- *Test Type*: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).  
- *Significance Level*: 0.05.

## üõ† Results and Outputs  

This section details the outcomes of various models, hypothesis testing, and feature analysis used in the project. Each result is supported by metrics and visualizations for clarity and deeper insights.

### 1. Model Performance  
Several models were evaluated to predict movie revenue effectively. These included variations of linear regression models and a Random Forest model. The key metrics for evaluation were Adjusted R¬≤ and Mean Squared Error (MSE).  

| *Model*       | *Adjusted R¬≤* | *MSE (Mean Squared Error)* | *Explanation*                                                |  
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Linear Model 1   | 0.74            | Higher                      | Used budget and runtime as predictors.                        |  
| Linear Model 2   | 0.78            | Moderate                    | Added cast and production-related variables for better fit.    |  
| Linear Model 3   | 0.81            | Moderate-Low                | Included all engineered features such as genres and keywords. |  
| Random Forest    | *Best Fit*    | *Lowest*                  | Nonlinear model that handles interactions and missing data effectively. |  

#### Key Takeaways:  
- *Linear Regression*:  
  - Model 3 showed the best performance among linear models with an Adjusted R¬≤ of 0.81.  
  - Residual analysis confirmed that assumptions such as homoscedasticity and normality were met.  
  - Linear models struggled with complex feature interactions, which reduced predictive accuracy.  
- *Random Forest*:  
  - Outperformed linear regression in both Adjusted R¬≤ and MSE.  
  - Particularly useful in capturing nonlinear interactions between features like budget, runtime, and popularity.  
  - Handles missing data seamlessly by generating estimates during training.

### 2. Hypothesis Testing  
*Objective*: To determine if budget and runtime significantly affect movie revenue.  

#### Statistical Approach:  
- *Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)*: Budget and runtime do not affect revenue.  
- *Alternate Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)*: Budget and runtime significantly affect revenue.  
- *Test Used*: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).  
- *Significance Level*: 0.05.  

#### Results:  
| *Variable*      | *P-value*  | *Decision*               | *Explanation*                                                |  
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Budget            | 0.001       | Reject H‚ÇÄ                 | Budget strongly influences revenue, with a direct relationship.|  
| Runtime           | 0.03        | Reject H‚ÇÄ                 | Runtime has a moderate impact, especially for blockbusters.    |  

*Detailed Observations*:  
1. *Budget*:  
   - Movies with higher budgets consistently generated more revenue.  
   - Budget alone accounted for more than 50% of the variance in revenue predictions.  

2. *Runtime*:  
   - Optimal runtime (90‚Äì120 minutes) significantly enhanced revenue potential.  
   - Extremely short or long runtimes showed diminishing returns.  

#### Visualization:  
- *Scatterplots with Regression Lines*:  
  - A combined plot visualized the interaction of budget and runtime with revenue.  
  - Regression lines confirmed the positive correlation between these variables and revenue.

### 3. Feature Importance (Random Forest)  
The Random Forest model provided insights into the most influential features for predicting revenue.  

| *Feature*          | *Importance Score* | *Impact on Revenue*                                                      |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Budget               | 0.87                | The strongest predictor; higher budgets consistently lead to higher revenue.|  
| Popularity           | 0.75                | Reflects audience demand, driven by marketing and star power.              |  
| Runtime              | 0.65                | Moderate impact; movies in the 90‚Äì120 minute range perform best.           |  
| Cast Size            | 0.60                | Larger casts, particularly with well-known actors, drive higher revenue.    |  
| Production Company   | 0.58                | Big producers like Disney and Warner Bros. significantly enhance success.   |  

#### Key Insights:  
- *Budget*: Investment in production quality and marketing is critical for success.  
- *Popularity*: Strong correlation with audience engagement, often tied to pre-release hype.  
- *Runtime*: A sweet spot exists; excessively long or short runtimes can hinder box office performance.

## üß™ Hypothesis Testing  

*Objective*: To determine whether budget and runtime significantly affect movie revenue.  

### Statistical Approach  
- *Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)*: Budget and runtime do not influence revenue.  
- *Alternate Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)*: Budget and runtime significantly impact revenue.  
- *Test Used*: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).  
- *Significance Level*: 0.05.  

### Results  
| *Variable*  | *P-value*  | *Decision*           | *Explanation*                                                |  
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Budget        | 0.001        | Reject H‚ÇÄ             | Budget strongly influences revenue, with a direct correlation. |  
| Runtime       | 0.03         | Reject H‚ÇÄ             | Runtime has a moderate but measurable impact on revenue.       |  

#### Key Observations:  
1. *Budget*:  
   - Movies with larger budgets typically generate significantly higher revenue.  
   - Investment in higher-quality production, marketing, and talent drives audience interest and engagement.  
   - Budget alone explains over 50% of the variance in revenue, making it the most critical feature.  

2. *Runtime*:  
   - Movies within the 90‚Äì120 minute range tend to perform best, balancing audience attention span and content delivery.  
   - Shorter movies (<90 minutes) often cater to niche genres (e.g., animated or comedies) with limited box office potential.  
   - Excessively long movies (>120 minutes) may lose audience interest unless they are epic productions.  

### Visualization  
To further support these results, scatterplots were created:  
- *Budget vs. Revenue*: Demonstrates a strong positive correlation, with higher budgets leading to greater revenue.  
- *Runtime vs. Revenue*: Shows an optimal range for runtime, with diminishing returns for very short or long movies.  
- Combined scatterplots with regression lines illustrate the interaction between budget, runtime, and revenue.  

#### Statistical Summary  
- The ANOVA test confirms the significance of budget and runtime, with both contributing to predicting movie revenue.  
- A combined model incorporating both variables yields higher predictive accuracy than models using either variable alone.
